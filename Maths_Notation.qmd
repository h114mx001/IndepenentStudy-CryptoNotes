# Mathematical Notation {#sec-MathBG}

As I cannot (and also do not need) to cover every single mathematical notations in this book, I will only listed some related to structures and its command in SageMath.

## Special sets 

+ $\mathbb{C}$: Complex numbers 
+ $\mathbb{R}$: Real numbers 
+ $\mathbb{Z}$: Integers 
+ $\mathbb{Q}$: Rational numbers 
+ $\mathbb{N}$: Natural numbers 
+ $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$: Set of integers mod $n$

An example of SageMath on these guys: 

```Python
"""
The following SageMath commands to call a set: 
"""
CC # Complex numbers with 53-bit of precision.
RR # Real numbers with 53-bit of precision.
ZZ # Integer Ring. 
QQ # Rational Field.
NN # Non-negative integer semi-ring.
Zmod(11) # aka Integers(11) or `IntegerModRing(11)`: Ring of modulo 11
```

+ The unit groups: $R^{\times}$ or $R^{*}$
+ Finite fields with $q$ elements: $\mathbb{F}_q$
+ General field: $k$
+ Algebraic closure of a field: $\bar{k}$

Example of SageMath codes:

```Python
GF(11)
```
```{sagemath}
GF(11)
```

```Python
GF(11).algebraic_closure()
```

```{sagemath}
GF(11).algebraic_closure()
```

Some interesting function for you to play with:

```Python
"""
`.parent()`: finding which field an element belongs to
"""
x = 7
print(x.parent())

x = 3.5
print(x.parent())
```

```{sagemath}
x = 7
print(x.parent())

x = 3.5
print(x.parent())
```

```Python
"""
`.lift()`: Lift an element from its parent to its... grandparent?
e.g: from quotient ring Q (R/I) -> R
"""
R = ZZ 
RI = Zmod(11)
x = RI(5)

print(x.parent())

y = x.lift()
print(y.parent())

print(y in R)
```

```{sagemath}
R = ZZ 
RI = Zmod(11)
x = RI(5)
print(x.parent())

y = x.lift()
print(y.parent())
print(y in R)
```

## Other important ones
+ $Pr(A)$ means the probability of an event $A$ to happen. Sometimes, you may see the notation $Pr[A]$ and $P(A)$ also.
