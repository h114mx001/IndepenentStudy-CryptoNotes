# Some attacks on Diffie-Hellman {#sec-Asymmetric}

In this chapter, we will cover the methods of breaking the Discrete Logarithm - the core of Diffie-Hellman. 

For the uniform, in this chapter, we will try to solve the problem of Discrete Logarithm on $g^x \equiv h \pmod p$, with $p, g, h$ are given.
