# Symmetric Cryptography {#sec-Symmetric .unnumbered}

Welcome to the first part of real crypto stuffs! I hope you are familiar with all previous materials!

As its name, `Symmetric Cryptography` is the types of cryptography where the key for both encryption & decryption process is the same.

In this section, we will cover mainly one of the most advanced symmetric-key algorithm: `AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)`, and some modes of operation around them. There will be some extra resources for you to read some older (and doomed) algorithms, like DES.
 
## Block cipher

In Cryptography, `Block Cipher` is a symmetric cryptographic algorithm that divides a plaintext into multiple blocks of equal length, and encrypts/decrypts each block separately. This pretty much same as some classical ciphers you may hear about, like Caesar, except a whole block is substituted rather than a single character. 

With supports of some modes of operations, we could have different ways of encrypt/decrypt, and also even change the block cipher into `stream cipher`, where each characters are substituted.
