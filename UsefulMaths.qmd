# Toddlers' Mathematics for PKC 

In this chapter, we will have a small walkthrough on some simple concepts of modular arithmetic that we needs for RSA and Diffie-Hellman. If you are good with these, feel free to continue.

## Assumption

The material here will assume that you have basic knowledge about modular arithmetic, how to do GCD and Extended GCD (via Euclidean and Extended Euclidean algorithm)

## Euler's Phi Totient

## Test

Given a number $n$, Euler's Phi Totient number defines the numbers of natural numbers $i \in [1, n)$ that its greatest common divisor with $n$ is $1$. This function is denoted as $\phi(n)$.

:::  

**Example: ** $\phi(20) = 8$, $\phi(4) = 2, \phi(5) = 4$

This totient has some important properties that is useful with RSA:

## Important Euler's Phi Totient Properties:

+ If $p$ is a prime, then $\phi(p) = p - 1$ 
+ If $GCD(a, b) = 1$, then $\phi(a\cdot b) = \phi(a) \cdot \phi(b)$
+ Given two numbers $a, n$ where $GCD(a, n) == 1$, then:
$$
a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod n
$$

## Inverse modulo n

Given a number $a$, the inverse modulo $n$ of $a$ is the number $x$ where: 

$$
ax \equiv 1 \pmod{n}
$$

This inverse should exist if $GCD(a, n) = 1$

## Fermat's Little Theorem

## Fermat's Little Theorem
Given two numbers $a, p$ where $GCD(a, p) = 1$, then $a^{p} \equiv a \pmod{p}$. 
Consequently, $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$

## Discrete Logarithm 

Given $a, h, n$ where there exists a number $x$ that $a^x \equiv h \pmod{n}$, the discrete logarithm problem is the process of finding the suitable number $x$ in $\mathbb{Z}_n$.

## Some (additional) Abstract Algebra

In here, I will introduce several simple concepts of group, generator, order of a group and order of a member of the group. Remember, these definitions are not formal, and it is written for more easily understanding. 

### Order

Come back to our example above, as $2$ can generate the set of 12 elements, the order of $2$ in the group $G$ is $12$. Indeed, the order of $5$ is $4$. 

Denoted the number $d$ as the order of the group. In some group, we cannot find $d_a$ for every $a$ in group, then these $a$ are called as having `infinite order`.

Also, the order of the generator is assigned to the `order of the group`. 

There are some properties with the order, that will be mentioned in some attacks on the DH and RSA:

## Properties of order in finite group

Let $G$ be a finite group. It has the order $n = |G|$. Let $a \in G$ and the order of $a$ is $d$.

+ Then, every element of $G$ has finite order. 
+ If there exists a number $k$ where $a^k \equiv e$, then $d | k$.
+ **(Lagrange's theorem)**. $d | n$ and $a^n \equiv e$.
