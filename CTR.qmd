# CTR {#sec-Symmetric}

The final mode of operation we will introduce will have a little bit different. While every other mode will have a fixed ciphertext for each plaintext, CTR will provide a different one every time we create new ciphers. This can be done because of the mechanism of `nonce` and `counter` (the name Counter Mode of CTR said it all).

In CTR, the nonce acts the same as IV in other modes, while the counter will be altered each time new message is required.
