    "text": "9.5 Some Abstract Algebra\nIn here, I will introduce several simple concepts of group, generator, order of a group and order of a member of the group. Remember, these definitions are not formal, and it is written for more easily understanding.\n\n9.5.1 Group\nFor simplicity, a group \\(G\\) is a set of elements, that supports an operation \\(\\star\\). In the group, the operation has the following properties:\n\nIdentity: There is an element \\(e \\in G\\) such that: \\(e\\star a = a \\star e = a\\) for every \\(a \\in G\\). \\(e\\) is called as the identity element.\nInverse: For \\(\\forall a \\in G\\), there is a unique \\(a^{-1}\\) where: \\(a \\star a^{-1} = e\\). \\(a^{-1}\\) is called as inverse.\nAssociative: For every \\(a, b, c \\in G\\), \\(a \\star (b \\star c) = (a \\star b) \\star c\\).\nCommutative: \\(a \\star b = b \\star a\\). A commutative group is also called abelian group.\n\nDuring the RSA and Diffie-Hellman (DH), we will talk much about the group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p\\). You can verify the properties yourself.\nA group with finite number of elements is called as a finite group.\n\n\n9.5.2 Generator\nTake the example of a group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{13}\\). If we compute number \\(2^x\\) where \\(0 \\le x \\lt p - 1\\), we can have a set:\n\\[\n\\{2^x\\} = \\{1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, 12, 11, 9, 5, 10, 7\\}\n\\]\nThis set is \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{13}\\). However, if we take another number, for example, 5:\n\\[\n\\{5^x\\} = \\{1, 5, 12, 8\\}\n\\]\n\\(2\\) is the generator of group \\(G = \\mathbb{Z}_{13}\\), but \\(5\\) isn’t.\nThen, generator of a group is the element that can generate the group, with the process you see above (in this multiplicative group, it can be done via exponent).\n\n\n9.5.3 Order\nCome back to our example above, as \\(2\\) can generate the set of 12 elements, the order of \\(2\\) in the group \\(G\\) is \\(12\\). Indeed, the order of \\(5\\) is \\(4\\).\nDenoted the number \\(d\\) as the order of the group. In some group, we cannot find \\(d_a\\) for every \\(a\\) in group, then these \\(a\\) are called as having infinite order.\nAlso, the order of the generator is assigned to the order of the group.\nThere are some properties with the order, that will be mentioned in some attacks on the DH and RSA:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties of order in finite group\n\n\n\nLet \\(G\\) be a finite group. It has the order \\(n = |G|\\). Let \\(a \\in G\\) and the order of \\(a\\) is \\(d\\).\n\nThen, every element of \\(G\\) has finite order.\nIf there exists a number \\(k\\) where \\(a^k \\equiv e\\), then \\(d | k\\).\n(Lagrange’s theorem). \\(d | n\\) and \\(a^n \\equiv e\\)."

    "text": "Welcome to the second part of this guide! With the previous part, we have a quick walkthrough for every part of symmetric cryptography. As you may recognize, the main uncomfortable thing of symmetric cryptography is that both party need to have an agreement on a same key. During the 1970s, some first attempts to remove this barrier has been successful. Since then, two party can use secured protection over their conversations.\nTwo main applications of asymmetric cryptography is:\n\nPublic key encryption: where Alice will use a public key to allow other people send messages to her, and another private key for her to read the ciphertext.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital signature: when Alice create some document, she can ‘sign’ into the document to verify her as the true owner. Any other people can verify it easily, just by some simple calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than that, Asymmetric cryptography can be used as a key sharing scheme (like Diffie-Hellman) that can be used in sharing the common key for the Symmetric Cryptography.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe anatomy of Asymmetric Cryptography is just like that. During this part, three significants cryptosystem will be demonstrated: RSA, Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange and a little bit on simple digital signature.\nIn the last chapters, the mechanism of Elliptic Curve Cryptography will also be included."

    "text": "Let’s go into the first cryptosystem in this section! RSA, named after its three inventors, is probably one of the most popular cryptosystem we are using.\nThe RSA algorithm is easy to understand.\nAssuming that, our Alice, want to establish a secure way to talk to the outsiders. She will choose her two prime numbers: \\(p\\), \\(q\\), based on the length of ciphertext she want. For example, in RSA-512, the \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) is 512-bit long.\nThen, she compute her \\(n = p\\cdot q\\). Then, the Euler’s totient for this number is \\[\n\\phi(n) = (p-1)\\cdot (q-1)\n\\]\nNext, she will choose a number \\(e\\), in a way that \\(GCD(e, \\phi(n)) = 1\\). The pair \\((e, n)\\) will be her public key.\nThen, she will compute a number \\(d = e^{-1} \\pmod{\\phi(n)}\\). Then, the public-key will be \\((e, n)\\) and private-key be \\((d, n)\\).\nFor anyone who want to send Alice something, they would compute the ciphertext: \\[\nc \\equiv m^{e} \\pmod n\n\\]\nWith this ciphertext, Alice will use her private key, \\(d\\) to decrypt:\n\\[\nc^d \\equiv (m^e)^d \\equiv m^{ed} \\pmod n\n\\]\nAs we know, \\(ed \\equiv 1 \\pmod{\\phi(n)}\\), then, we can rewrite it as \\(ed = k\\phi(n)+1\\)\nAlso, if \\(GCD(m, n) = 1\\) (almost 100% as the two only factors of \\(n\\) are \\(p, q\\)), then \\(m^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n\\), we can rewrite as:\n\\[\nm^{ed} \\equiv m^{k\\phi(n)+1} \\equiv m^{k\\phi(n)} \\cdot m \\equiv 1 \\cdot m \\equiv m \\pmod{n}\n\\]\nThe security of RSA, come from the trapdoor function of factorizing the large semiprime \\(n\\), from its two huge factors \\(p, q\\). The direct attacks on RSA is on this public key, then finding back the private key for the plaintext.\nNormal, in CTF, the target for us is to find the backdoor in the cryptosystem, and from the given ciphertext, find back the answer.\nThe next chapter will talk about some beginner-intermediate level of attack RSA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSA in real cases\n\n\n\nBreaking the RSA in both real life and in CTFs required more than these attacks. According to the structures of cryptosystem, there will be more vulnerabilities than listed ones in this documentation."

    "text": "20.1 Hash function\nIn general, you can think the hash function as taking an arbitrary long data, and then ‘compress’ it into a much smaller (and fixed size) string. It appears in many data structures, string recognition and many others in computer science.\nWith Cryptographic Hash Function, the function should be one-way: impossible to invert. Comparing with public key cryptography, this is a little bit different, as PKC processes could be invertible if some secrets is known. Here is an example of SHA1:\n\nCryptographic hash functions are used to validate messages, generate digital signatures, and store passwords securely in databases.\nHash functions are particularly helpful in asymmetric cryptography for compressing arbitrary length communications to a value with a smaller bit-length than the modulus when signing messages using RSA or protocols such as (EC)DSA or Elgamal.\nNormally, the cryptographic hash functions must be resistant to this three forms of attacks:\n\nPre-image attack: Given \\(x = hash(m)\\), it must be practically impossible to find \\(hash(m_0) = x\\). (This can be interpreted as one-way function).\nSecond pre-image attack: given \\(m_1, hash(m_1)\\), it must be impossible find \\(m_2\\) that \\(hash(m_1) = hash(m_2)\\).\nCollision: It must be practically impossible to find any pair of messages \\(m_1, m_2\\) that \\(hash(m_1) = hash(m_2)\\). The main difference of collision and second pre-image is that, collision do not require a known \\(m_1\\), but searching for a pair.\n\nOne remarkable think is: if a pre-image attack is known, then, it could lead to consequences as second pre-image attack and collision; but having a collision is not necessarily lead to other attacks.\nIn Python, hashlib works pretty well as a hash generator.\nimport hashlib\nh = hashlib.new('sha256')\nh.update(b\"Nobody inspects the spammish repetition\")\nh.hexdigest()\n\n\n'031edd7d41651593c5fe5c006fa5752b37fddff7bc4e843aa6af0c950f4b9406'\n\n\nYou can look more deeply in the hashlib documentation."

    "text": "20.2 Merkle–Damgård construction\nMerkle–Damgård construction is a proven way to build a good hash function.\n\nWe can talk pretty much about this Construction, but I will write here several key points in it:\n\nIt is proven that, if the block \\(f\\) is cryptographically secured, then the whole MD construction is secured.\nThe padding is a must-have in cryptographic hash function. And it also needs to be done in a good way.\n\nFor example, if we pad the message with only \\x00 if it does not fit the block of MD construction, then this two message:\nm1 = 'aaaaaaaaaaa'\naaa|aaa|aaa|aa0|\n              |padding\nm2 = 'aaaaaaaaaaa0'\naaa|aaa|aaa|aa0|\nwill have the same hash results. Normally, regardless of the size of message fits the required length for each block or not, the hash function will always pad it with some values.\n\nSad news many algorithm built on Merkle–Damgård is not cryptographically safe anymore, one big example is MD5.\n\nComputing the hash value of this two value raises the same hash:\na = 0xd131dd02c5e6eec4693d9a0698aff95c2fcab58712467eab4004583eb8fb7f8955ad340609f4b30283e488832571415a085125e8f7cdc99fd91dbdf280373c5bd8823e3156348f5bae6dacd436c919c6dd53e2b487da03fd02396306d248cda0e99f33420f577ee8ce54b67080a80d1ec69821bcb6a8839396f9652b6ff72a70\na_faker = 0xd131dd02c5e6eec4693d9a0698aff95c2fcab50712467eab4004583eb8fb7f8955ad340609f4b30283e4888325f1415a085125e8f7cdc99fd91dbd7280373c5bd8823e3156348f5bae6dacd436c919c6dd53e23487da03fd02396306d248cda0e99f33420f577ee8ce54b67080280d1ec69821bcb6a8839396f965ab6ff72a70\nimport hashlib\nhashMachine = MD5.new(a)\nprint(hashMachine.hexdigest())\nhashMachine = MD5.new(a_faker)\nprint(hashMachine.hexdigest())\n\n\n008ee33a9d58b51cfeb425b0959121c9\n008ee33a9d58b51cfeb425b0959121c9\n\n\nA very cool properties that hashes based on Merkle–Damgård construction is that, if a collision is found, if we append same bytes into the collision, it will continue to become a collision (You may can explain it by looking at MD construction)."

For knowing this IV states, we can compute the continuous block. If attacker needs to forge a hash of \\(m || p || z || p'\\), for \\(p'\\) is the padding for \\(z\\), he would use IV as \\(hash(m || p)\\).\nAn example on Wikipedia:\nOriginal Data: count=10&lat=37.351&user_id=1&long=-119.827&waffle=eggo\nOriginal Signature: 6d5f807e23db210bc254a28be2d6759a0f5f5d99\nIf the hacker needs to craft this message:\nDesired New Data: count=10&lat=37.351&user_id=1&long=-119.827&waffle=eggo&waffle=liege\nAs we have known the signature of previous data, we can compute the hash value of the desired data, with IV = hash of original."
