    "text": "9.5 Some Abstract Algebra\nIn here, I will introduce several simple concepts of group, generator, order of a group and order of a member of the group. Remember, these definitions are not formal, and it is written for more easily understanding.\n\n9.5.1 Group\nFor simplicity, a group \\(G\\) is a set of elements, that supports an operation \\(\\star\\). In the group, the operation has the following properties:\n\nIdentity: There is an element \\(e \\in G\\) such that: \\(e\\star a = a \\star e = a\\) for every \\(a \\in G\\). \\(e\\) is called as the identity element.\nInverse: For \\(\\forall a \\in G\\), there is a unique \\(a^{-1}\\) where: \\(a \\star a^{-1} = e\\). \\(a^{-1}\\) is called as inverse.\nAssociative: For every \\(a, b, c \\in G\\), \\(a \\star (b \\star c) = (a \\star b) \\star c\\).\nCommutative: \\(a \\star b = b \\star a\\). A commutative group is also called abelian group.\n\nDuring the RSA and Diffie-Hellman (DH), we will talk much about the group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p\\). You can verify the properties yourself.\nA group with finite number of elements is called as a finite group.\n\n\n9.5.2 Generator\nTake the example of a group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{13}\\). If we compute number \\(2^x\\) where \\(0 \\le x \\lt p - 1\\), we can have a set:\n\\[\n\\{2^x\\} = \\{1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, 12, 11, 9, 5, 10, 7\\}\n\\]\nThis set is \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{13}\\). However, if we take another number, for example, 5:\n\\[\n\\{5^x\\} = \\{1, 5, 12, 8\\}\n\\]\n\\(2\\) is the generator of group \\(G = \\mathbb{Z}_{13}\\), but \\(5\\) isn’t.\nThen, generator of a group is the element that can generate the group, with the process you see above (in this multiplicative group, it can be done via exponent).\n\n\n9.5.3 Order\nCome back to our example above, as \\(2\\) can generate the set of 12 elements, the order of \\(2\\) in the group \\(G\\) is \\(12\\). Indeed, the order of \\(5\\) is \\(4\\).\nDenoted the number \\(d\\) as the order of the group. In some group, we cannot find \\(d_a\\) for every \\(a\\) in group, then these \\(a\\) are called as having infinite order.\nAlso, the order of the generator is assigned to the order of the group.\nThere are some properties with the order, that will be mentioned in some attacks on the DH and RSA:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties of order in finite group\n\n\n\nLet \\(G\\) be a finite group. It has the order \\(n = |G|\\). Let \\(a \\in G\\) and the order of \\(a\\) is \\(d\\).\n\nThen, every element of \\(G\\) has finite order.\nIf there exists a number \\(k\\) where \\(a^k \\equiv e\\), then \\(d | k\\).\n(Lagrange’s theorem). \\(d | n\\) and \\(a^n \\equiv e\\)."

    "text": "Welcome to the second part of this guide! With the previous part, we have a quick walkthrough for every part of symmetric cryptography. As you may recognize, the main uncomfortable thing of symmetric cryptography is that both party need to have an agreement on a same key. During the 1970s, some first attempts to remove this barrier has been successful. Since then, two party can use secured protection over their conversations.\nTwo main applications of asymmetric cryptography is:\n\nPublic key encryption: where Alice will use a public key to allow other people send messages to her, and another private key for her to read the ciphertext.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital signature: when Alice create some document, she can ‘sign’ into the document to verify her as the true owner. Any other people can verify it easily, just by some simple calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than that, Asymmetric cryptography can be used as a key sharing scheme (like Diffie-Hellman) that can be used in sharing the common key for the Symmetric Cryptography.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe anatomy of Asymmetric Cryptography is just like that. During this part, three significants cryptosystem will be demonstrated: RSA, Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange and a little bit on simple digital signature.\nIn the last chapters, the mechanism of Elliptic Curve Cryptography will also be included."

This book is released as a result of an Independent Study course about basic Cryptography, conducted by Nguyen Tuan Anh (h114mx001, supervised by Professor Wray Buntine); from College of Engineering and Computer Science, VinUniversity.\nThis book targets the newcomers to Cryptography field, from guiding you from basic implementation of some cryptography schemes, to some more advance and popular ones. From perspectives of a crypto learner, I included a lot of practical work (implementations, explanation, etc.) about how to work and/or break some usual cryptosystems. Also, you will find yourself more familiar with some most useful tools in your cryptography work (in this book, I choose Python and a CAS build on it, SageMath as main tools).\nThis website and book will always be free to access, licensed under the CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 license.

    "text": "Let’s go into the first cryptosystem in this section! RSA, named after its three inventors, is probably one of the most popular cryptosystem we are using.\nThe RSA algorithm is easy to understand.\nAssuming that, our Alice, want to establish a secure way to talk to the outsiders. She will choose her two prime numbers: \\(p\\), \\(q\\), based on the length of ciphertext she want. For example, in RSA-512, the \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) is 512-bit long.\nThen, she compute her \\(n = p\\cdot q\\). Then, the Euler’s totient for this number is \\[\n\\phi(n) = (p-1)\\cdot (q-1)\n\\]\nNext, she will choose a number \\(e\\), in a way that \\(GCD(e, \\phi(n)) = 1\\). The pair \\((e, n)\\) will be her public key.\nThen, she will compute a number \\(d = e^{-1} \\pmod{\\phi(n)}\\). Then, the public-key will be \\((e, n)\\) and private-key be \\((d, n)\\).\nFor anyone who want to send Alice something, they would compute the ciphertext: \\[\nc \\equiv m^{e} \\pmod n\n\\]\nWith this ciphertext, Alice will use her private key, \\(d\\) to decrypt:\n\\[\nc^d \\equiv (m^e)^d \\equiv m^{ed} \\pmod n\n\\]\nAs we know, \\(ed \\equiv 1 \\pmod{\\phi(n)}\\), then, we can rewrite it as \\(ed = k\\phi(n)+1\\)\nAlso, if \\(GCD(m, n) = 1\\) (almost 100% as the two only factors of \\(n\\) are \\(p, q\\)), then \\(m^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n\\), we can rewrite as:\n\\[\nm^{ed} \\equiv m^{k\\phi(n)+1} \\equiv m^{k\\phi(n)} \\cdot m \\equiv 1 \\cdot m \\equiv m \\pmod{n}\n\\]\nThe security of RSA, come from the trapdoor function of factorizing the large semiprime \\(n\\), from its two huge factors \\(p, q\\). The direct attacks on RSA is on this public key, then finding back the private key for the plaintext.\nNormal, in CTF, the target for us is to find the backdoor in the cryptosystem, and from the given ciphertext, find back the answer.\nThe next chapter will talk about some beginner-intermediate level of attack RSA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSA in real cases\n\n\n\nBreaking the RSA in both real life and in CTFs required more than these attacks. According to the structures of cryptosystem, there will be more vulnerabilities than listed ones in this documentation."

Basically, his method will convert the modular polynomials under a modulo to a normal polynomial in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), then we can apply the numerical analysis method on the new polynomial. This conversion is supported by an algorithm called LLL lattice basis reduction\nTo provide a quick example, we will examine if a RSA process using a fixed padding scheme.\nAssume we have two guys is sharing their AES-256 key. As they know RSA without padding is vulnerable, they used this padding scheme:\n\\[\nm = 2^{1024} - 2^{128} + k\n\\]\nFor \\(k\\) is their key. \\(m\\) is the padded-key.\nTherefore, the ciphertext will be sent can be written as:\n\\[\nc \\equiv (2^{1024} - 2^{128} + k)^e \\pmod n\n\\]\nThen, we could have a polynomial \\(f(x) = (2^{1024} - 2^{128} + k)^e - c = 0\\) under the \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\).\nWith the Coppersmith’s method, we can solve this polynomial for \\(k\\):\nfrom Crypto.Util.number import *\n\ne = 3\np, q = getPrime(512), getPrime(512)\nn = p*q \nkey = getRandomNBitInteger(128)\n# print(key)\nm = 2**1024 - 2**128 + key\nc = pow(m, e, n)\nprint(c)\n\nK = Zmod(n)\nP.<x> = PolynomialRing(K, implementation = 'NTL')\nf = (2^1024 - 2^128 + x)^e - c \nkeyBroken = f.small_roots()[0]\nassert keyBroken == key\nprint(keyBroken)\n\n\n82633033845796004747549573332791642419336976223134503191365351063499016327870528606411650067623106729110435236002973001108860823873209355855425694267378772683429911986067425672621927056108387620153618400631818657150449693722782685126044287318464943689078280311043761541667438647198552521827816508055402758969\n\n\n\n\n\n286929976551044907179886525566763542034\n\n\nThe Coppersmith’s method is applied in a very wide range of attacks if there is a fixed relationship between the components of RSA. A very noticable case is the ROCA attack, that have leaked more than hundred thousands of ID cards in Estonian."

In the same sense, this hardness is applied on Alice and Bob if they want to know the other’s secret."
