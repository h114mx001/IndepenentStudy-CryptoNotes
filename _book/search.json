This book is released as a result of an Independent Study course about basic Cryptography, conducted by Nguyen Tuan Anh (h114mx001, supervised by Professor Wray Buntine); from College of Engineering and Computer Science, VinUniversity.\nThis book targets the newcomers to Cryptography field, from guiding you from basic implementation of some cryptography schemes, to some more advance and popular ones. From perspectives of a crypto learner, I included a lot of practical work (implementations, explanation, etc.) about how to work and/or break some usual cryptosystems. Also, you will find yourself more familiar with some most useful tools in your cryptography work (in this book, I choose Python and a CAS build on it, SageMath as main tools).\nThis website and book will always be free to access, licensed under the CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 license. Currently, the only way for you to get a physical copy of this document is print my website out.\nIndeed, this book will not end here, updated version will continue (based on my skills and your demands too!). After this (final) version, you can expect next versions of the document."

Therefore, the basics of SageMath/Python will be mentioned in the book, but not the all attacks’ implementations. I know that there are many available samples on GitHub; however, gaining experiences by playing around with debugging, ‘math’-ing, and programming is better, rights?\nHowever, do not afraid about the hard problems. At any point of this book, you will find some exercises (that I find it should work for gaining your skills) to practice with. Also, do not afraid to contact me via social medias 😎!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nLet’s write something (as clear as you can) about what you want to learn or love about Cryptography and what do you expect this book has. 100% I can give you all the stuff you need, but I am sure you will find them out if you REALLY want to finish (and extend) your checklist!\n\n\nThat’s enough for the text!

    "text": "In cryptography, the mode of operation of the block cipher allows encryption of more than one block of data using the same packet cipher key. The block cipher itself can only encrypt a single block of data whose length is equal to the length of the cipher block. To encrypt longer data, the data must ﬁrst be divided into several separate chunks. Usually, the last block of data needs to be expanded to match the block size using appropriate padding. The mode of operation describes the process of encrypting each data block and is often randomized using an additional initiali- zation vector (IV) to ensure security. The study of modes of operations used to include data integrity protection, i.e., the error propagation characteristics of the cipher, if some byte is modiﬁed. Subse- quent research has treated integrity protection as an entirely different cryptosystem- independent goal of cryptography. Some modern modes of operations combine encryption (conﬁdentiality) and authentication in an efﬁcient way, which is called authentication encryption."

As you may recognize, the main uncomfortable thing of symmetric cryptography is that both party need to have an agreement on a same key. During the 1970s, some first attempts to remove this barrier has been successful. Since then, two party can use secured protection over their conversations.\nTwo main applications of asymmetric cryptography is:\n\nPublic key encryption: where Alice will use a public key to allow other people send messages to her, and another private key for her to read the ciphertext.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital signature: when Alice create some document, she can ‘sign’ into the document to verify her as the true owner. Any other people can verify it easily, just by some simple calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than that, Asymmetric cryptography can be used as a key sharing scheme (like Diffie-Hellman) that can be used in sharing the common key for the Symmetric Cryptography.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe anatomy of Asymmetric Cryptography is just like that. During this part, three significants cryptosystem will be demonstrated: RSA, Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange and a little bit on simple digital signature.\nIn the last chapters, the mechanism of Elliptic Curve Cryptography will also be included."
