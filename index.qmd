# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This **'CryptoBook for n00b1es'** is a beginner guide, with the main purpose is for any beginners who want to poke around with Cryptography in a practical way. This book is released as a result of an Independent Study course about basic Cryptography, conducted by **Nguyen Tuan Anh** ([h114mx001](https://github.com/h114mx001), supervised by Professor [**Wray Buntine**](https://vinuni.edu.vn/people/wray-buntine-phd/)); from College of Engineering and Computer Science, VinUniversity. 

This book targets the newcomers to Cryptography field, from guiding you from basic implementation of some cryptography schemes, to some more advance and popular ones. From perspectives of a crypto learner, I included a lot of practical work (implementations, explanation, etc.) about how to work and/or break some usual cryptosystems. Also, you will find yourself more familiar with some most useful tools in your cryptography work (in this book, I choose Python and a CAS build on it, SageMath as main tools). 

Indeed, this book will not end here, updated version will continue (based on my skills and your demands too!). After this (final) version, you can expect next versions of the document.
