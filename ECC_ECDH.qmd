# Elliptic Curve Cryptography and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman 

## ECDLP (Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem)

+ In here, we can simply define the ECDLP that $\text{log}_P(Q) = n$ when $nP = Q$ in $E(\mathbb{F_p})$
+ It turns out to be the ECDLP is also a hard problem. 

## ECDH

As nothing changes quite much, we can define ECDH as we have done with DH of modular arithmetic.

After the process, Alice and Bob can use either $x$ or $y$ for their same secret.

One other notable, finding a good generator for elliptic curve is **not easy**. So, Alice & Bob often use pre-computed curve, generator and prime.


## Little conclusion

Along with key sharing, Elliptic Curve can also be applied in building Public key cryptography and digital signature as RSA does. 

However, this is not discussed pretty much, as:
+ The main purposes of new cryptographic schemes are sharing rather than encrypt, as other cryptography like AES can be done pretty well the encrypt/decrypt. 

+ Several PKC on Elliptic Curve requires 4-to-1 (4 ciphertext to 1 plaintext), because ECC goes with points, rather than plain numbers. 

Right now, the theme is also shifting into `Lattice-based Cryptography`, which built on the problems on `Matrix in Integer Field`.
