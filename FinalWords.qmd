# Final Word {.unnumbered}

Hi! That's all of our journey (just for temporary).

Thank you for reading until this final page. Along the book, I would have several mistakes. Therefore, I would really appreciate your recommendations, fixes, etc. via connecting me at `@h114mx001`!

For the reference of the books, please look at the chapters: `Guide on Mathematics & Crypto sources`. I have put it all in here!

Thank you once time more! Goodbye and good luck during your infosec and crypto path!
