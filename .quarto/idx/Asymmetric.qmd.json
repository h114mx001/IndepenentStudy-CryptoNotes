With the previous part, we have a quick walkthrough for every part of symmetric cryptography. As you may recognize, the main uncomfortable thing of symmetric cryptography is that both party need to have an agreement on a same key. During the 1970s, some first attempts to remove this barrier has been successful. Since then, two party can use secured protection over their conversations. \n\nTwo main applications of asymmetric cryptography is:\n\n+ **Public key encryption**: where Alice will use a public key to allow other people send messages to her, and another private key for her to read the ciphertext.\n\n![](/images/PKC.png){width=\"50%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n+ **Digital signature**: when Alice create some document, she can 'sign' into the document to verify her as the true owner. Any other people can verify it easily, just by some simple calculations.\n\n![](/images/DigitalSignature.png){width=\"50%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nMore than that, Asymmetric cryptography can be used as a key sharing scheme (like Diffie-Hellman) that can be used in sharing the common key for the Symmetric Cryptography.\n\n![](/images/DH.png){width=\"50%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThe anatomy of Asymmetric Cryptography is just like that. During this part, three significants cryptosystem will be demonstrated: **RSA**, **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange** and a little bit on simple digital signature. \n\nIn the last chapters, the mechanism of Elliptic Curve Cryptography will also be included.
