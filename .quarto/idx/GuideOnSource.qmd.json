In terms of the purpose of this document, we will not go too deep in any Mathematics here. However, here are some books that I think may help you a lot when studying some first cryptos:\n\nAlso, before working with the few next chapters, you should be comfortable with:\n\n+ Modular Arithmetic (Concepts of modulo, GCD, etc.)\n+ Python (if you are good at SageMath, it's really appreciated!)\n+ Some simple binary operations `(AND, OR, XOR, NOT, etc.)`\n+ Learning something cool!\n\n## Sources:\n\nHere is some books that I am reading during my crypto path, and also websites that I practice crypto:\n\n### Course\n\nThe only course, that I would recommend now is the [Cryptography I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto) course from professor Dan Boneh, Stanford University. This course would help you have a good background in both Mathematics and Theory of Crypto, also programming exercises included too. Also, you can have a certificate xD. \n\n\n### Books\n\n**Crypto-dedicated**:\n\n+ [An Introduction To Mathematical Cryptography](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-77993-5)\n+ [Mathematics for Public Key Cryptography](https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~sgal018/crypto-book/main.pdf)\n\n**Maths**:\n\n+ [Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications](http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/aata-toc.html)\n\n**General InfoSec**:\n\n+ [Handbook for CTF-ers](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-19-0336-6) - Highly recommend if you are new to infosec.\n\n### Practice sites\n\n+ [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org): A good site for both beginner and gurus, and a really practical & close to CTFs\n\n+ [CryptoPals](cryptopals.com): Learn cryptography by programming and understanding the concepts from the scratch (also good if you want to learn a new programming language).\n\n(Will be update soon if I remember more =)))\n\nThat's all! Let's go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"GuideOnSource.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","bibliography":["references.bib"],"jupyter":{"kernelspec":{"name":"sagemath","language":"sagemath","display_name":"SageMath 9.6"}},"editor":{"render-on-save":true},"theme":"zephyr"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","toc":true,"highlight-style":"github","output-file":"GuideOnSource.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"jupyter":{"kernelspec":{"name":"sagemath","language":"sagemath","display_name":"SageMath 9.6"}},"editor":{"render-on-save":true},"documentclass":"scrbook","papersize":"A4"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
