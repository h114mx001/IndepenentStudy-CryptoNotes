Remember, these definitions are not formal, and it is written for more easily understanding. \n\n### Group\n\nFor simplicity, a group $G$ is a set of elements, that supports an operation $\\star$. In the group, the operation has the following properties:\n\n+ **Identity**: There is an element $e \\in G$ such that: $e\\star a = a \\star e = a$ for every $a \\in G$. $e$ is called as the `identity element`.\n\n+ **Inverse**: For $\\forall a \\in G$, there is a unique $a^{-1}$ where: $a \\star a^{-1} = e$. $a^{-1}$ is called as `inverse`.\n\n+ **Associative**: For every $a, b, c \\in G$, $a \\star (b \\star c) = (a \\star b) \\star c$.\n\n+ **Commutative**: $a \\star b = b \\star a$. A commutative group is also called `abelian group`. \n\nDuring the RSA and Diffie-Hellman (DH), we will talk much about the group $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. You can verify the properties yourself. \n\nA group with finite number of elements is called as a `finite group`.\n\n### Generator\n\nTake the example of a group $\\mathbb{Z}_{13}$. If we compute number $2^x$ where $0 \\le x < p - 1$, we can have a set: \n\n$$\n\\{2^x\\} = \\{1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, 12, 11, 9, 5, 10, 7\\}\n$$\n\nThis set is $\\mathbb{Z}_{13}$. However, if we take another number, for example, 5: \n\n$$\n\\{5^x\\} = \\{1, 5, 12, 8\\}\n$$\n\n$2$ is the generator of group $G = \\mathbb{Z}_{13}$, but $5$ isn't.\n\nThen, **generator** of a group is the element that can generate the group, with the process you see above (in this multiplicative group, it can be done via exponent).\n\n### Order\n\nCome back to our example above, as $2$ can generate the set of 12 elements, the order of $2$ in the group $G$ is $12$. Indeed, the order of $5$ is $4$. \n\nDenoted the number $d$ as the order of the group. In some group, we cannot find $d_a$ for every $a$ in group, then these $a$ are called as having `infinite order`.\n\nAlso, the order of the generator is assigned to the `order of the group`. \n\nThere are some properties with the order, that will be mentioned in some attacks on the DH and RSA:\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Properties of order in finite group\n\nLet $G$ be a finite group. It has the order $n = |G|$. Let $a \\in G$ and the order of $a$ is $d$.\n\n+ Then, every element of $G$ has finite order. \n+ If there exists a number $k$ where $a^k \\equiv e$, then $d | k$.\n+ **(Lagrange's theorem)**. $d | n$ and $a^n \\equiv e$. \n\n:::"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"UsefulMaths.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","bibliography":["references.bib"],"jupyter":{"kernelspec":{"name":"sagemath","language":"sagemath","display_name":"SageMath 9.6"}},"editor":{"render-on-save":true},"theme":"zephyr"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","toc":true,"highlight-style":"github","output-file":"UsefulMaths.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"jupyter":{"kernelspec":{"name":"sagemath","language":"sagemath","display_name":"SageMath 9.6"}},"editor":{"render-on-save":true},"documentclass":"scrbook","papersize":"A4"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
